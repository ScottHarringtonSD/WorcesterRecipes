    preamble: "This dish was a family favourite growing up; a little taste of Andalucía in rural South Derbyshire, and with a story of friendship to match the warming comfort of the dish… In the early 2000s my mother began working as a French and German teacher. It was difficult, and she often spent long periods after the school day ended in her classroom preparing lessons. However, during this time she befriended a fellow teacher named Julia. Julia was a veteran teacher and helped my mother to settle into the school, and they soon became good friends. However, all too soon Julia left South Derbyshire to a new life in the sun in southern Spain. Before long, my mother made the journey to Spain to visit Julia. A far cry from the run-down corridors of William Allit secondary school (which has now been closed and condemned for demolition), Julia’s new home was breathtaking. Surrounded by orange orchards and beautiful countryside, it felt like paradise. It was here that my mother was introduced to Chorizo Chicken for the first time. Julia had tried it in a local restaurant and loved it so much that she took the recipe home. When my mother returned home, she brought back not just fond memories of time well spent with a treasured friend, but also the recipe for this dish. It became a staple in our house, and when I left for university, I missed it so much that I asked my mother for the recipe. A recipe that will soon make another step in its journey from Spain to you… Sadly, due to dietary restrictions I never had the opportunity to make this for my housemates, except for one occasion, when I made it for my housemate Nina, who subsequently fell violently ill and had to be hospitalized.",
